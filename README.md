I am a fourth-year student pursuing Electrical and Electronic Engineering @ Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University. I love to have new experiences, meet new people and learn new things. I have an exquisite blend of experience in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery etc.

I worked on Fiver as a front-end developer for about 2 years and completed 7 projects with a 5-star rating.

 I also have knowledge of Arduino, competitive programming and MATLAB.
